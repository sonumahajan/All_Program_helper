Division Problem Code: DIVEO
--------------------------------
Chef has an integer N. He repeats the following operation until N becomes 1.

Chef chooses an integer X such that X>1 and X is a divisor of N and then divides N by X (the new value of N becomes N/X). If X is even, Chef gets A points otherwise he gets B points
Can you find the maximum points Chef can get if he performs the operations optimally?

Input Format
-----------------
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input containing three integers N,A,B.

Output Format
------------
For each testcase, output in a single line the maximum points Chef can get.

Constraints
--------------
1≤T≤2⋅103
2≤N≤109
−103≤A,B≤103

Sample Input 1

10 2 3
15 5 -2
12 2 3
8 -1 0
Sample Output 1

-2
7
-1
Explanation
-------------------
Test case 1: First Chef divides N=10 by 2 and gets 2 points and then divides by 5 and thus gets 3 points. Hence Chef gets a total of 2+3=5 points.

Test case 2: Chef divides N by 15. Hence he gets −2 points.
